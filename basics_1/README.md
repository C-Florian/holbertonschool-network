# Networking basics #1

## Description
This project is the continuation of Networking basics #0.  
It focuses on local name resolution, loopback addresses, and simple TCP listening with `netcat`.

We learn the difference between `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, and how `/etc/hosts` works.  
We also practice how to display IP addresses of the machine and how to listen on a TCP port.
