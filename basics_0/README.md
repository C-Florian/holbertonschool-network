# Networking basics #0

## Description
This project is an introduction to the fundamentals of computer networking.  
It covers the OSI model, different types of networks, IP and MAC addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, common ports, and tools such as `ping` and `netstat`.  

The goal is to understand basic networking concepts and practice with simple Bash scripts to explore how devices communicate on a network.
